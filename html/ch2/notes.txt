Div and span were used a lot with earlier versions of html. 
They are still included with current versions of html for backwards compatibility.
They really only should be used for stylistic purposes going forward.
The reason is they are too generic. Hard to search on.
Its recommended to use more meaningful tags <header>,<main>,<section>,<article>,<nav> and <footer>
